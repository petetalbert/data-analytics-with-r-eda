# Tuition cost

count - fct_reorder - geom_col() - coord_flip() TECHNIQUE


```{r}
tuition_cost_um <- tuition_cost %>% 
  filter(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"))

tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code, type) %>% 
  mutate(state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, n, .fun = sum)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()


tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code, type) %>% 
  mutate(state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, n, .fun = sum)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()

```

How would we sort highest to lowest proportion of state?

```{r}
tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code, type) %>% 
  group_by(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(public_pct = if_else(type == "Public", pct, 0),
         state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, public_pct, .fun = max)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  count(state_code, type) %>% 
  group_by(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(type == "Public")
```

## Introduce `pivot_longer()` with state dataset

What if I wanted to compare the average costs by state for each type of cost column?

```{r}
tuition_cost_um %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(mean(room_and_board), 
            mean(in_state_tuition), 
            mean(in_state_total), 
            mean(out_of_state_tuition), 
            mean(out_of_state_total))
```

Works fine, but how in the world would I *plot* something like this? Would have to go one at a time for each cost (because they're each in a different column).

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(room_and_board, in_state_tuition, in_state_total, out_of_state_tuition, out_of_state_total), 
               names_to = "cost_type", 
               values_to = "cost") %>% 
  group_by(state, cost_type) %>% 
  summarize(avg_cost = mean(cost))
```

Gotta deal with those NAs.

## Introduce `pivot_wider()` with the diversity dataset

```{r}
diversity_school %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = enrollment)
# error: explain
# filter NA college data
diversity_school %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = enrollment, values_fn = length) %>% View()

diversity_school_non_na <- diversity_school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name))

diversity_school_non_na %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, 
              values_from = enrollment) %>% 
  print(., width = 300)


```

## Presentation-ready plots

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  filter(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = in_state_tuition, color = state)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +

ggsave("um-tuition.png", p, width = 6, height = 4, units = "in", dpi = 700)

```



```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  filter(state_code == "MN", degree_length == "4 Year", !is.na(room_and_board)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(room_and_board, in_state_tuition, in_state_total, out_of_state_tuition, out_of_state_total), 
               names_to = "cost_type", 
               values_to = "cost") %>% 
  mutate(cost_type = str_to_sentence(str_replace_all(cost_type, "_", " "))) %>% 
  group_by(type, cost_type) %>% 
  summarize(avg_cost = mean(cost)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cost_type, y = avg_cost, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip()
```




## Introduce `inner_join()` with state dataset


```{r}
states <- bind_cols(state_code = state.abb, state_region = state.region, state_division = state.division)

tuition_cost_region <- tuition_cost %>% 
  inner_join(states, by = "state_code") %>% 
  select(name, state, state_code, state_region, state_division, room_and_board, in_state_tuition)
```

Perfect example of inner vs left join!

```{r}
tuition_cost_region %>% 
  count(state_region, state_code, type) %>% 
  group_by(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(public_pct = if_else(type == "Public", pct, 0),
         state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, public_pct, .fun = max)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ state_region, scales = "free_y")

tuition_cost_region %>% 
  count(state_division, state_code, type) %>% 
  group_by(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(public_pct = if_else(type == "Public", pct, 0),
         state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, public_pct, .fun = max)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ state_division, scales = "free_y")

tuition_cost_region %>% 
  count(state_division, state_code, type) %>% 
  group_by(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(public_pct = if_else(type == "Public", pct, 0), # NEED TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS.
         state_code = fct_reorder(state_code, public_pct, .fun = max)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ state_division, scales = "free_y")
```


NA values for state!!!

## `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and window functions

```{r}
tuition_cost_um %>% 
  mutate(cost_rank = min_rank(desc(in_state_tuition))) %>% 
  select(name, state, type, in_state_tuition, cost_rank)
```


## Let's hone in on the upper midwest just to make things a little easier

```{r}
tuition_cost_um <- tuition_cost %>% 
  filter(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"))

tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code)

tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code, type)

tuition_cost_um %>% 
  count(state_code, type, degree_length)

```

## Who's the most expensive in the upper midwest?

```{r}
tuition_cost_um %>% 
  arrange(desc(out_of_state_total)) %>% 
  head(10)
```

## Relationship between room and board and tuition?

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_and_board, y = out_of_state_tuition)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_and_board, y = out_of_state_tuition, color = type)) +
  geom_point()

tuition_cost %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_and_board, y = out_of_state_tuition, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10()

tuition_cost %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_and_board, y = out_of_state_tuition, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Wow, seems like although private universities are obviously more expensive, their room and board costs may be relatively cheaper. How would we try to determine that?

```{r}
# more uses for mutate

tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_tuition_ratio, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)


tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  #filter(room_tuition_ratio < 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_tuition_ratio, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  scale_x_log10()

tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  filter(room_tuition_ratio < 2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_tuition_ratio, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)

# what happens when we have NA values????

tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ratio = mean(room_tuition_ratio),
            median_ratio = median(room_tuition_ratio))

tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(room_tuition_ratio)) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ratio = mean(room_tuition_ratio),
            median_ratio = median(room_tuition_ratio),
            n = n())
```

This shows that on average, room and board is relatively cheaper at private universities...

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_tuition_ratio, y = out_of_state_tuition)) + 
  geom_point()

#mega transformed!!!
tuition_cost %>% 
  mutate(upper_mid = if_else(state_code %in% c("MN", "WI", "ND", "SD", "IA"), "Y", "N"),
         room_tuition_ratio = room_and_board / out_of_state_tuition) %>% 
  filter(room_tuition_ratio > 0.1, type != "For Profit") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_tuition_ratio, y = out_of_state_tuition)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = type), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma_format())
```

It seems like universities who chargle less for tuition tend to have to charge more for room and board to make up the difference???

# What does the public-private breakdown look like by state?

```{r}
tuition_cost_pp <- tuition_cost %>% 
  filter(type %in% c("Public", "Private"))

tuition_cost_pp %>% 
  count(state_code, type) %>% 
  group_by(state_code) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(type == "Public") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state_code, y = pct)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

## In-state vs. out-of-state tuition depending on public or private

Public tends to give lower tuition for in-state; Private tends to give higher tuition for in-state

```{r}

```

# Diversity data

add count to check for dups: `add_count()` and `distinct`.

```{r}
diversity_school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name), category == "Total Minority") %>% 
  mutate(pct_soc = enrollment / total_enrollment) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  add_count() %>% View()

diversity_school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name), category == "Total Minority") %>% 
  mutate(pct_soc = enrollment / total_enrollment) %>% 
  distinct(name)
```

schools with 0% SOC are jewish universities :-); universities with 100% SOC are historically Black colleges, and Native American colleges, or extremely small.

```{r}
diversity_school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name), category == "Total Minority") %>% 
  mutate(pct_soc = enrollment / total_enrollment) %>% 
  arrange(pct_soc)

diversity_school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name), category == "Total Minority") %>% 
  mutate(pct_soc = enrollment / total_enrollment) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_soc))
```

Where are the top 10 large universities with the largest % of students of color?

```{r}
diversity_school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name), category == "Total Minority", total_enrollment >= 10000) %>% 
  mutate(pct_soc = enrollment / total_enrollment) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_soc)) %>% 
  top_n(10, pct_soc)
```

What is their demographic make-up?

```{r}

```



### Pennsylvania's private two-year institutions

Many of the private, two-year institutions in Pennsylvania are technical colleges and trade schools; this makes sense as Pennsylvania has a large industrial and manufacturing economy. These private institutions are nearly all more expensive than public two-year options.

```{r}
tuition_cost_top %>% 
  filter(state == "Pennsylvania", type == "Private", degree_length == "2 Year") %>% 
  select(name, in_state_tuition) %>% 
  arrange(desc(in_state_tuition)) %>% 
  mutate(in_state_tuition = dollar(in_state_tuition)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Private two-year institutions in PA", row.names = TRUE, col.names = c("College Name", "In-state tuition"))
```



```{r}
salary_potential_top %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mid_early_difference)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2500) +
  facet_wrap(~ state_name)
```


### Does in-state tuition predict early-career pay?

```{r}
salary_tuition %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = in_state_tuition, y = early_career_pay)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2, type = "qual")
```

No relationship, seemingly. The divide here is private vs. public

```{r}
salary_tuition %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = in_state_tuition, y = early_career_pay, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2, type = "qual")
```

### Does out-of-state tuition predict early-career pay?

```{r}
salary_tuition %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = out_of_state_tuition, y = early_career_pay, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2, type = "qual")
```

### Does in-state tuition predict mid-career pay?

```{r}
salary_tuition %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = in_state_tuition, y = mid_career_pay, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2, type = "qual")
```

### Does out-of-state tuition predict mid-career pay?

```{r}
salary_tuition %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = out_of_state_tuition, y = mid_career_pay, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2, type = "qual")
```

* On the low-end, public actually out-performs private in terms of career pay. But on the very upper end of tuition, private pays off.


## dplyr vs. base R

arrange

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  arrange(desc(out_of_state_total))

tuition_cost[order(tuition_cost$out_of_state_total, decreasing = TRUE), , drop = FALSE]
```

group_by / summarize

```{r}
tuition_cost %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(median_out_of_state_total = median(out_of_state_total))

tuition_cost_by <- by(tuition_cost, tuition_cost$state, function(df) {
  with(df, data.frame(state = state[[1]], median_out_of_state_total = median(out_of_state_total)))
})

str(tuition_cost_by)

as_tibble(do.call(rbind, tuition_cost_by))
```
